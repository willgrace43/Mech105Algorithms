Matlab function that determines the LU Factorization of a square matrix
Utilizes partial pivoting if needed
Includes error checking

## Inputs
* A - Coefficient matrix (must be square)

## Outputs
* L - Lower triangular matrix with 1's across the diagonal
* U - Upper triangular matrix with 1's across the diagonal
* P - Pivot matrix
